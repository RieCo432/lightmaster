# lightmaster
An upgrade from the sicrib project allowing for more modularity and easier configuration.


A significant step up from the sicrib project. This newer version is intended to make it easier to configure the length, position and orientation of lighting strips to allow for temporospatial inferencing of lighting effects. 
This eliminates the need for tedious manual configuration of every effect for the setup in question.
